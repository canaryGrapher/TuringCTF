          Monkeys are furry animals with long, fur-covered tails and hands with
          thumbs. There are more than 260 different species of monkeys in the
          world. Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of
          mammals, in part, the simians of infraorder Simiiformes.

            World and New World monkeys:</span
          ><br />
          The noses of New World monkeys are flatter than the narrow noses of
          the Old World monkeys, and have side-facing nostrils. Old World
          monkeys don’t have prehensile tails; New World monkeys do. Old World
          monkeys have cheek pouches, where food is stuffed on the run so it can
          be chewed later; New World monkeys don’t have cheek pouches. Old World
          monkeys have sitting pads on their rumps, but New World monkeys do
          not.

          Monkeys generally reside in forests, high plains, grasslands and
          mountains. The lifespan of a monkey is 10 to 50 years, depending on
          the species.
